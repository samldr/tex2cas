# About
I wrote this translator to turn TeX into a format that calculators can read and process.

## Current Limitations:

    - no recursive fractions
    - no recursive sqrts
    - backslash commands must be separated by a space (ex. '(x+3) \cdot (x+4)) in the input
    - exponents must also be separated by a space  (ex. 'x ^{3x+2} *23) in the input

## To-do:
    - fix all the limitations
    - add try-catch
    - add proper input (discord bot, website, etc.)
